<div class="project-card">
  <h3>🛰️ AI‑STelemetry</h3>
  <h4 style="margin-top: -10px; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">
    Intelligent Anomaly Detection and Insight Discovery for Satellite Telemetry
  </h4>
  <p>
    A high-resolution, AI-powered system for autonomous analysis of orbital telemetry.  
    AI‑STelemetry combines machine learning, signal diagnostics, and adaptive monitoring to uncover hidden anomalies, extract actionable patterns, and support real-time decision-making in space missions and satellite operations.  
    It integrates multi-source satellite data from <strong>TLE</strong>, <strong>Sentry</strong>, and <strong>EPIC</strong> to enable intelligent fusion and interpretation across orbital dynamics, Earth imaging, and near-Earth object forecasting.
